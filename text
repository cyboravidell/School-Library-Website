                <p>Education for me is “educare” which means to nourish children in such a way that their best can
                    bring out and they develop into confident and responsible Human Being for the Nature and Society
                    as well. <br>
                    The real goal of education is full flowering of young minds by making them experience the
                    significance of love, fellowship, freedom, justice and harmony. <br>
                    ​Every child is unique, with unimaginable possibilities we have to make an effort to go beyond
                    schooling to learning and take on the challenge of preparing every child to play different roles
                    in his/her life. <br>
                    I believe in Interactive teaching and in those methods and measures which can motivate children
